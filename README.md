## File Mapping Class Module Plus a Portable Executable \(PE\) Format Verifier


</div>

### Description

This is a DEMO Application on Using my FileMapping VB Class Module

to Simulate the use of File Mapping APIs

Used in Visual C++ and Win32 Assembly, Why in Visual Basic, Why Not?

FileMapping Class Module



----

Tired of using the traditional Visual Basic File Handling Routines, or

even FileSystemObject failed to read to a file byte-by-byte, or you want to

Access a File Using Pointers for Better Scalability Performance, while

Some Anti-Virus Blocks the use of very useful FileSystemObject,

File Mapping Functions comes into a handy set of routines just waiting for

you to use them, and take note, we people as Visual C++ and Win32 Assembly

uses this functions, because we dont have easy macros.

Why use easy routines, and limiting your performance, use File Mapping, thats

the only way!!!

yup, Visual Basic doesn't support Pointer Variables, but there is a CopyMemory

"RtlMoveMemory" to do the same effects (a little slower than the real pointers

but that will do just fine)

Included in this ZIP file is my Class Module to perform FileMapping and a demo

Project on how to use the File Mapping by Traversing to an Executable format

and checks whether it is a valid Win32 Portable Executable Format and finally

checks what type of PE it is, PE32 or PE64



----

This code checks for a valid PE Executable Format

To understand this Application, you need to consult your nearest

PE Documentation.

Win32 Assembly Codes are included in Comments are 100% working on

TASM32 Compiler,
